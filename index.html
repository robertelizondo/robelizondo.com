    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am freshman Enineering student at Texas A&M University. I have always loved to create and expirament with new thigs, and so this is my first go at creating a website from the gorud up. I am from Dallas, Texas. I currently know Python fluently and a bit of Java and MySQL. I am learning HTML5/CSS/JavaScript which is what I used to create this website! I am still learning many of the skills necessary to become a great programmer and hope to one day start my own software company.

    <h1>Previous Work</h1>
    <p>
        I have worked on a number of software projects and mainly focus on frontend development. AggieScan is an iOS phone applicaton that allows users to virtualize thier student ID cards. This application was developed with Swift, Laraval and MySQL during the 24-hour hackathon, TAMUhack. Safr is a cross platform mobile application that tackels the probelem of wreckless driviing in South-east Asia. The application was developed and pitched during the 48-hour event, Aggies Invent. It uses TensorFlow to detect if users are wearing a seatbelt or helmet and rewards them with points that can be redeemed for flight points, gas price reduction or food coupons. This application was develpoed in React Native so that all users may have access to the application.
